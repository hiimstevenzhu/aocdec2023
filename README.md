collation of codes (mostly in python) to solve daily advent of code puzzles

i'm taking this opportunity while i'm finished with finals to freshen up on python (its been over a year since i last used it)

what i'm hopefully expecting is that i'll be able to do these:
1) be familiarised with more QoL python syntax
2) write cleaner code - i'd like to find a good balance between clear naming and unnecessarily long viariable names
3) possibly find faster solutions that i've never tried before!
